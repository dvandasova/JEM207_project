# JEM207_project
## Spectators Unlimited Ltd. (Final project of subject JEM207)

### Motivation for the Project
Sports tourism refers to travel which involves either observing or participating in a sporting event while staying apart from the tourists' usual environment ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_tourism)). It is also one of the fastest-growing segments of tourism (estimated growth rate of 17.5% between 2023-2030) generating around 10% of the worldâ€™s expenditure on tourism ([UN Tourism](https://www.unwto.org/sport-tourism)).
In Europe, however, this segment still remains rather unsaturated. And that is where spectators Unlimited Ltd. enter the game.

### Spectators Unlimited Ltd. Solution
We bring sports tourism to the public such that once someone secures their ticket, he can select pre-made packages with travel and accommodation options based on package attributes and his budget. Our use case will be demonstrated on the case of [XX] which will take place after the project's deadline and will therefore ensure smooth performance of the code.

### Technology Toolkit
[to be finalized upon finishing the code] Can this be replaced by the requirements.txt file?
- What libraries and components of them we used and something about them - version, why? etc.
- In case of geopy, mention that it uses openmaps (or what)

### Project Components
Spectators Unlimited Ltd. solution contains the following components:
1. Input
2. Flights
3. Accommodation Possibilities
4. Geo-locations
5. Combination Algorithm
6. Output

Each component and its functionalities are further described below.

#### Input
[to be finalized upon finishing the code]
[Disclaimer] For the input to work it is necessary to download the internal-data excel file and the input txt file from the repository "Datasets" and replace filepaths leading to the files in your repository.
- Accepts .txt file with a code of event
- The file also contains the full list of events with available codes to choose from
- After reading the .txt file, the app then contain a condition that results in error messafe if the code does not match with codes from the list

#### Flights
[to be finalized upon finishing the code]
- What library/ API was used?
- What site was scraped?
- What were some interesting aspects of the scraping? Eg. what components had to be scraped or overcame
- What attributes were obtained?

#### Accomodation Possibilities
[to be finalized upon finishing the code]
- What library/ API was used?
- What site was scraped?
- What were some interesting aspects of the scraping? Eg. what components had to be scraped or overcame
- What attributes were obtained?

#### Geo-locations
[to be finalized upon finishing the code]
- What library/ API was used?
- How were locations obtained
- How were distances obtained

#### Combination Algorythm
[to be finalized upon finishing the code]
- What weights were placed at each attributes?
- What travel packages were built?

#### Output & Visualization
[to be finalized upon finishing the code]
- How does the output look like?
- Visualizations???
